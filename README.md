# 💳 Loan Approval Prediction – Random Forest & Logistic Regression

## 📝 Overview

This project uses **loan approval data** to build and evaluate models that predict whether a customer will be approved or denied for a loan.
We apply **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression** to classify potential customers, helping the bank target pre-approval offers to those most likely to qualify.

**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## 🎯 Objective

A large bank aims to increase its customer base by sending **pre-approval loan offers**.
The challenge is to target individuals who are **highly likely to be approved**.
This project develops predictive models using historical customer data to support this goal.
